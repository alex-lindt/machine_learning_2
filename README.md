# Machine Learning 2
Exercises for the course Machine Learning 2 at the University of Amsterdam.

Labs in collaboration with [David Biertimpel](https://github.com/d4vidbiertmpl).

Topics were (among others):

- Common probability distributions
 -Graphical models: Bayesian networks and Markov network
- Expectation maximization
- Variable elimination, belief propagation
- Approximate variational inference
- Sampling methods, MCMC
- Sequential models: HMM and Kalman filters
- Causality (Causal Bayesian Networks)
